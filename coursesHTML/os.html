          <p><strong>Operating System : </strong>An <strong>Operating System</strong> is a piece of software that
            manages all the
            resources of a computer system both hardware and
            software and provides an environment in which users can perform tasks by executing the applications or
            processes in a
            convenient and efficient manner. OS hides the complexity of the hardware by working as resource manager.</p>

          <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> Objectives Of Operating System</h2>
          <p><strong>The main targets of an operating system are as follows :</strong></p><br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Convenience :</strong>An operating system improves the use of a Hardware. Operating systems
                gives the ability to users to use systems without
                the stress of configuring system and resource management.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Efficiency :</strong>An Operating System has the ability to manage all the resources properly
                and use them as needed. This is due to less
                time spent on configuring the system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Ability to evolve :</strong>An operating system should be designed in such a way that it allows
                for the effective development, testing, and
                introduction of new features without interfering with service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Management Of System Resources :</strong>Operating systems are able to share resources fairly
                among various processes that are running and user.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Memory Management: </strong></p>
              <p>Operating System Manages the primary or main memory. If any program is executed, it has to be present
                in the memory.
                Main memory is faster than Secondary memory and directly accessed by the CPU. When a program is executed
                the operating
                system allocates the required memory to the process of it and by the CPU it handles the process in an
                efficient manner
                after the completion of the process Operating System deallocates the memory and free up the space in
                main memory for
                another process.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Allocates and Deallocates the memory.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Keeping the record of which part of memory is used and which process is using.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Distributing the memory while multiprocessing etc.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>CPU Management or Scheduling:</strong></p>
              <p>Every software that runs on a computer, whether in the background or in the frontend, is a process.
                Processor management
                is an execution unit in which a program operates. The operating system determines the status of the
                processor and
                processes, selects a job and its processor, allocates the processor to the process, and de-allocates the
                processor after
                the process is completed</p>
              <p>When more than one process runs on the system the OS decides how and when a process will use the CPU.
                Hence, the name is
                also <strong>CPU Scheduling
                  The OS:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Manages the CPU uses by process.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Keeps the record of CPU status</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Certain algorithms used for CPU Scheduling in OS are as follows :</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>First Come First Out.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Shortest Job First.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Round-Robin Scheduling.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Priority-based scheduling etc</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p><strong>Purpose of CPU scheduling:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Proper utilization of CUP is necessary. Operating System makes sure that the CPU should be as busy

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Since every device should get a chance to use the processor. Hence, the OS makes sure that the
                    devices get fair
                    processor time
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>

            <li>
              <p><strong>File Management:</strong></p>
              <p>The operating system manages resource allocation and deallocation. It specifies which process receives
                the file and for
                how long. It also keeps track of information, location,uses,status, and so on. These groupings of
                resources are referred
                to as file systems. The files on a system are stored in different directories.</p>
              <p><strong>The Operating System :</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Storage management:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Storage management</strong>is defined as it refers to the management of the data storage
                equipment’s that are used to store the user/computer
                generated data. Hence it is a tool or set of processes used by an administrator to keep your data and
                storage
                equipment’s safe. Storage management is a process for users to optimize the use of storage devices and
                to protect the
                integrity of data for any media on which it resides and the category of storage
                management generally contain the different type of subcategories covering aspects such as security,
                virtualization and
                more, as well as different types of provisioning or automation, which is generally made up the entire
                storage management
                software market.
              </p>
              <p><strong>The OS uses storage management for:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Improving the performance of the data storage resources.</p>
